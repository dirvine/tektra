- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests verify character count accuracy and visual feedback

### ‚úÖ Requirement 4.2: Clear visual focus indicators
- **Implementation**: `animate_focus()` method with enhanced focus animations
- **Features**:
  - Smooth focus animations with border and shadow effects
  - Visual enhancement through margin adjustments (simulating border glow)
  - Integration with animation manager for consistent effects
  - Separate focus/unfocus animation states
- **Testing**: Tests verify animation manager calls and focus state management

### ‚úÖ Requirement 4.3: Enter key sends message with keyboard shortcuts
- **Implementation**: `_on_enter_pressed()` method with enhanced behavior
- **Features**:
  - Enter key triggers message sending when input is valid
  - Proper validation before sending (non-empty, within character limits)
  - Integration with send button state management
  - Callback system for message handling
- **Testing**: Tests verify Enter key functionality and message sending flow

### ‚úÖ Requirement 4.4: Send button disabled when input is empty with visual feedback
- **Implementation**: `_update_send_button_state()` method with smooth animations
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic enable/disable based on input validation
  - Smooth color transitions (enabled: primary color, disabled: surface color)
  - Animation feedback for state changes
  - Integration with voice recording state (disabled during recording)
- **Testing**: Tests verify button state management and animation calls

### ‚úÖ Requirement 4.5: Auto-expanding input field with smooth height transitions
- **Implementation**: `_handle_auto_expansion()` method with intelligent height calculation
- **Features**:
  - Dynamic height calculation based on text length and line breaks
  - Smooth transitions between min and max height limits
  - Character-based line estimation for text wrapping
  - Height reset when text is cleared
- **Testing**: Tests verify height changes and expansion behavior

### ‚úÖ Requirement 4.6: Visual feedback for voice recording state
- **Implementation**: `_toggle_voice_recording()` method with comprehensive state management
- **Features**:
  - Visual state changes (üé§ ‚Üí üî¥) for recording indication
  - Background color changes to indicate recording state
  - Input field disabling during voice recording
  - Status indicator updates ("üé§ Recording...")
  - Proper state restoration when recording stops
- **Testing**: Tests verify voice state management and visual feedback

## Technical Implementation Details

### Core Components
- **EnhancedInputField**: Main component class with comprehensive functionality
- **AnimationManager Integration**: Seamless integration with the animation system

- **Visual Indicators**: Color-coded feedback for different states
- **Character Limits**: Proper enforcement with visual warnings
- **Input Sanitization**: Whitespace handling and validation

## Integration Points

### Chat Panel Integration
- **Seamless Integration**: Enhanced input field integrates perfectly with existing ChatPanel
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility with existing code through reference mapping
- **Feature Enabling**: Voice and file features can be enabled/disabled dynamically

### Animation System Integration
- **Animation Manager**: Full integration with the centralized animation system
- **Performance Monitoring**: Animations respect performance constraints
- **Reduced Motion**: Proper accessibility support for reduced motion preferences

## Testing Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **16 test methods** covering all functionality
- **100% requirement coverage** for all 4.1-4.6 requirements
- **Integration tests** with ChatPanel and animation system
- **Error handling tests** for robust operation
- **Edge case testing** for character limits and validation

### Test Results
- ‚úÖ All 16 tests passing
- ‚úÖ Integration tests successful
- ‚úÖ Animation system tests passing
- ‚úÖ Message bubble renderer tests passing
