- **Balanced**: Balanced performance (10 concurrent animations, 0.8x quality)
- **Performance**: Performance-focused (6 concurrent animations, 0.6x quality)
- **Minimal**: Low-end systems (3 concurrent animations, 0.4x quality)
- **Fallback**: Emergency mode (1 concurrent animation, 0.2x quality)

**Automatic Optimization Features:**
- **Dynamic profile switching** based on performance metrics
- **Animation queuing system** for overloaded scenarios
- **Memory usage monitoring** with per-profile limits
- **Animation skipping logic** for non-essential animations

- **Background monitoring lifecycle** management
- **Graceful shutdown** with resource cleanup

**Performance-Optimized Animation Method:**
```python
async def animate_with_performance_optimization(
    self, animation_type: AnimationType, widget: toga.Widget, **kwargs
) -> Optional[str]
```
