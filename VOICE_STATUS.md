# Tektra Voice Input Status

## Current Implementation (Test Mode)

The voice input feature is currently in **test mode** with simulated audio recording. This means:

1. **No Mac Microphone Icon**: The microphone icon won't appear in your Mac's menu bar because we're not accessing real hardware yet.

2. **Simulated Audio**: When you toggle "Always Listening", the app generates test audio data (a 440Hz tone) to verify the audio pipeline works.

3. **Permissions Ready**: The app has proper entitlements configured:
   - `com.apple.security.device.microphone`
   - `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`
   - `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` in Info.plist

## Why Test Mode?

We're using simulated audio temporarily because:
- The `cpal` audio library has complex Send/Sync requirements with Tauri's state management
- This allows testing the UI and data flow without dealing with platform-specific audio APIs yet

## Next Steps for Real Audio

To implement real microphone access, we need to:

1. **Option A: Use cpal with proper threading**
   - Handle the Stream type outside of Tauri's state system
   - Use channels for communication between audio thread and main app

2. **Option B: Use platform-specific APIs**
   - macOS: AVFoundation or CoreAudio directly
   - More control but requires Objective-C/Swift bridging

3. **Option C: Use a different audio library**
   - Consider `rodio` or platform-specific alternatives
   - May have better Tauri compatibility

## Testing the Current Implementation

1. Click the "Always Listening" toggle in the Voice Controls panel
2. You'll see a message about test mode
3. The app will simulate recording (no actual microphone access)
4. The voice indicator will show activity
5. Audio data is being generated and buffered (test tone)

## What Works Now

- âœ… UI for voice controls
- âœ… Always-listening toggle
- âœ… Audio buffer management
- âœ… Progress events and status updates
- âœ… Proper permissions configured
- âœ… Gemma-3n model responses
