# Tektra Vendor Implementation Guide

## Phase 1: Immediate Implementation

### Step 1: Backup Current State
```bash
# Create backup of current working system
git branch backup-before-vendor
git checkout -b implement-vendor-system
```

### Step 2: Fork Upstream Dependencies
```bash
# Fork mistral.rs
cd vendor/mistralrs
git clone https://github.com/EricLBuehler/mistral.rs.git .
git remote add tektra-upstream https://github.com/dirvine/mistral.rs.git
git checkout -b tektra-main

# Fork candle
cd ../candle  
git clone https://github.com/huggingface/candle.git .
git remote add tektra-upstream https://github.com/dirvine/candle.git
git checkout -b tektra-main

# Initialize hf-hub-tektra
cd ../hf-hub-tektra
git init
mkdir -p src
echo "pub mod tektra_hub;" > src/lib.rs

# Initialize tokenizers-custom
cd ../tokenizers-custom
git init
mkdir -p src
echo "pub mod tektra_tokenizers;" > src/lib.rs
```

### Step 3: Update Main Cargo.toml
```toml
[dependencies]
# Replace mistralrs with vendored version
tektra-inference = { path = "vendor/mistralrs" }

# Replace direct candle deps with vendored
tektra-candle = { path = "vendor/candle" }

# Add enhanced model management
tektra-models = { path = "vendor/hf-hub-tektra" }

# Add custom tokenizers
tektra-tokenizers = { path = "vendor/tokenizers-custom" }

# Keep existing dependencies that don't need vendoring
safetensors = "0.4"
accelerate-src = "0.3"
half = "2.4"
# ... rest unchanged
```

## Phase 2: Progressive Migration

### Week 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] **Day 1-2**: Fork and clone all upstream repositories
- [ ] **Day 3-4**: Set up basic Cargo.toml structures with path dependencies
- [ ] **Day 5**: Create minimal wrapper APIs that delegate to upstream
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Verify that existing functionality still works with vendored deps

### Week 2: Enhanced Progress Integration  
- [ ] **Day 1-3**: Implement enhanced progress tracking in tektra-inference
- [ ] **Day 4-5**: Add granular file-level progress in tektra-models  
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Integrate new progress system with existing Avatar loading UI

### Week 3: Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **Day 1-3**: Implement Metal-specific optimizations in tektra-candle
- [ ] **Day 4-5**: Add memory management improvements across all modules
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Performance benchmarking and optimization verification

### Week 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] **Day 1-3**: Comprehensive test suite for all vendored modules
- [ ] **Day 4-5**: Integration testing with existing Tektra functionality
- [ ] **Day 6-7**: Performance regression testing and final optimization

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Compatibility Issues**: Maintain API compatibility wrappers
- **Performance Regression**: Comprehensive benchmarking at each step
- **Build Complexity**: Gradual migration with fallback options
- **Maintenance Burden**: Automated testing and CI/CD integration

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Migration**: One module at a time with verification
2. **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable vendored modules during development
3. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline for each vendored module
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous benchmarking and alerts
5. **Rollback Plan**: Git branches and backup strategies

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process
1. **Morning**: Review overnight CI/CD results and performance metrics
2. **Development**: Implement features with comprehensive tests
3. **Testing**: Run integration tests against existing Tektra functionality
4. **Benchmarking**: Compare performance with baseline measurements
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation and implementation notes
6. **Evening**: Commit changes and trigger CI/CD pipeline

### Code Review Process
1. **Self-Review**: Comprehensive review of changes and tests
2. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline with performance regression detection
3. **Manual Testing**: Interactive testing with Tektra application
4. **Performance Review**: Benchmark comparison and analysis
5. **Documentation Review**: Ensure changes are properly documented

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Continuous Monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Inference speed, memory usage, startup time
- **Error Rates**: Failed model loads, network errors, crashes  
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, disk I/O during operation
- **User Experience**: Progress tracking accuracy, loading smoothness

### Monthly Maintenance
- **Upstream Synchronization**: Review and merge relevant upstream changes
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Full suite of performance tests
- **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability assessment of vendored code
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep implementation guide current

### Quarterly Reviews
