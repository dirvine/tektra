  - `GET /api/v1/security/vault/*` - Vault operations

### 📦 Dependencies Added

#### **New Security Dependencies**
```toml
security = [
    "cryptography>=41.0.0",      # Encryption/decryption
    "aiofiles>=23.0.0",          # Async file operations
    "face-recognition>=1.3.0",   # Face recognition
    "speechbrain>=0.5.16",       # Voice recognition
    "scipy>=1.11.0",             # Scientific computing

    "numpy>=1.24.0,<2.0.0",      # Numerical operations
]
```

## 🛡️ Security Architecture

### **Zero Trust Principles**
1. **Biometric Authentication**: Face + Voice + PIN required
2. **Local Processing**: All biometric data processed locally
3. **Encrypted Storage**: AES-256 encryption for all user data
4. **Query Anonymization**: PII removed before external API calls
5. **Session Management**: Secure token-based sessions with timeout

### **Data Protection Layers**
1. **Layer 1**: Biometric authentication (something you are)
2. **Layer 2**: PIN authentication (something you know) 
3. **Layer 3**: Encrypted vault storage (AES-256-CBC)
4. **Layer 4**: Query anonymization for external APIs
5. **Layer 5**: Session management and audit trails

### **Privacy Guarantees**
- ✅ Biometric data never stored raw (only hashes)
- ✅ All conversations encrypted at rest
- ✅ External queries completely anonymized
- ✅ User vaults cryptographically isolated
- ✅ No data transmission outside lab environment

## 🔄 Upgrade Framework Ready

### **Hot-Swappable Capabilities**
