# Tektra Standalone Desktop App Development Plan

## Objective
Transform Tektra from a Docker-dependent architecture to a fully self-contained desktop application with embedded Unmute voice AI.

## Critical Requirement
NO external services, NO Docker, NO separate processes. Everything runs in a single Python application that can be distributed via Briefcase.

## Phase 1: Remove Container Dependencies

### 1. Analyze Unmute Integration Requirements
- Study the unmute git submodule structure
- Document which Python files contain the actual model inference code
- List all Python dependencies needed for Unmute to run directly
- Identify model files and their sizes

### 2. Create Embedded Unmute Integration
Create `src/tektra/voice/unmute_embedded.py`:
```python
import sys
from pathlib import Path

# Add unmute to path
UNMUTE_PATH = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent.parent / "unmute"
sys.path.insert(0, str(UNMUTE_PATH))

class EmbeddedUnmute:
    """Direct integration of Unmute models without containers"""
    
    def __init__(self, model_dir: Path):
        self.model_dir = model_dir
        self.stt_model = None
        self.tts_model = None
        self.llm_model = None
        
    async def initialize_models(self):
        """Load all models directly from unmute codebase"""
        # Import unmute components directly
        # Load models into memory
        # No Docker, no services, just Python
        pass
        
    async def transcribe_audio(self, audio_data: bytes) -> str:
        """Direct STT inference"""
        pass
        
    async def generate_response(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Direct LLM inference"""
        pass
        
    async def synthesize_speech(self, text: str) -> bytes:
        """Direct TTS inference"""
        pass
3. Replace Docker-Based Services

Delete or deprecate services.py (Docker-based)
Remove all Docker dependencies from pyproject.toml
Update pipeline_real.py to use EmbeddedUnmute
Remove WebSocket client, use direct function calls

Phase 2: Model Distribution Strategy
4. Implement Model Management
Create src/tektra/models/model_manager.py:
pythonclass ModelManager:
    """Manages model files for standalone distribution"""
    
    def __init__(self, app_data_dir: Path):
        self.model_dir = app_data_dir / "models"
        self.model_urls = {
            "unmute_stt": "https://...",  # Define actual URLs
            "unmute_tts": "https://...",
            "unmute_llm": "https://...",
            "qwen_vl": "https://..."
        }
        
    async def ensure_models_available(self, progress_callback=None):
        """Download models if not present"""
        for model_name, url in self.model_urls.items():
            model_path = self.model_dir / model_name
            if not model_path.exists():
                await self.download_model(url, model_path, progress_callback)
                
    def get_model_path(self, model_name: str) -> Path:
        """Get local path to model"""
        return self.model_dir / model_name
5. Update Briefcase Configuration
Modify pyproject.toml:
toml[tool.briefcase.app.tektra]
# Add model handling
support_package = "3.11"  # Ensure Python version compatibility
cleanup_paths = ["__pycache__", "*.pyc"]  # Don't bundle unnecessary files

# Platform-specific model handling
[tool.briefcase.app.tektra.macOS]
info_plist_entries = {
    "LSMinimumSystemVersion" = "10.15",  # For ML framework support
}

[tool.briefcase.app.tektra.windows]
# Windows-specific ML runtime requirements
6. Progressive Loading UI
Create src/tektra/gui/startup_screen.py:
pythonclass StartupScreen:
    """Shows progress while models load"""
    
    def __init__(self, main_window):
        self.main_window = main_window
        self.progress_bar = None
        
    def show_model_download(self, model_name: str, progress: float):
        """Update UI with download progress"""
        # Show which model is downloading
        # Update progress bar
        # Estimate time remaining
Phase 3: Integrated Voice Pipeline
7. Rewrite Voice Pipeline for Embedded Use
Update src/tektra/voice/pipeline_embedded.py:
pythonclass EmbeddedVoicePipeline:
    """Voice pipeline using embedded models"""
    
    def __init__(self, unmute: EmbeddedUnmute):
        self.unmute = unmute
        self.is_listening = False
        self.audio_queue = asyncio.Queue()
        
    async def start_listening(self):
        """Start audio capture and processing"""
        # Capture audio from microphone
        # Process with embedded STT
        # No WebSocket, no external service
        
    async def process_audio_stream(self):
        """Process audio in real-time"""
        while self.is_listening:
            audio_chunk = await self.audio_queue.get()
            
            # Direct STT processing
            text = await self.unmute.transcribe_audio(audio_chunk)
            
            if text:
                # Direct LLM processing  
                response = await self.unmute.generate_response(text)
                
                # Direct TTS processing
                audio_response = await self.unmute.synthesize_speech(response)
                
                # Play audio directly
                await self.play_audio(audio_response)
8. Memory-Efficient Model Management
Create src/tektra/core/resource_manager.py:
pythonclass ResourceManager:
    """Manages memory and resources for embedded models"""
    
    def __init__(self, memory_limit_gb: float = 4.0):
        self.memory_limit = memory_limit_gb * 1024 * 1024 * 1024
        self.loaded_models = {}
        
    async def load_model(self, model_name: str, model_loader):
        """Load model with memory management"""
        # Check available memory
        # Unload other models if needed
        # Load requested model
        
    def get_memory_usage(self):
        """Monitor current memory usage"""
        pass
Phase 4: Complete Standalone App
9. Main Application Integration
Update src/tektra/app.py:
pythonclass TektraApp(toga.App):
    def startup(self):
        """Initialize standalone app"""
        # No Docker checks
        # No service startup
        # Direct model initialization
        
        self.model_manager = ModelManager(self.paths.app)
        self.unmute = EmbeddedUnmute(self.model_manager.model_dir)
        self.voice_pipeline = EmbeddedVoicePipeline(self.unmute)
        
        # Progressive initialization
        asyncio.create_task(self.initialize_models())
        
    async def initialize_models(self):
        """Load models with progress display"""
        # Show startup screen
        startup = StartupScreen(self.main_window)
        
        # Download/load models
        await self.model_manager.ensure_models_available(
            progress_callback=startup.show_model_download
        )
        
        # Initialize embedded Unmute
        await self.unmute.initialize_models()
        
        # Enable features
        self.enable_voice_features()
10. Distribution Configuration
Create distribution/build_standalone.py:
python"""Build script for standalone distribution"""

def prepare_models_for_distribution():
    """Prepare models for bundling or download"""
    # Option 1: Bundle small models
    # Option 2: Download large models on first run
    # Option 3: Hybrid approach
    
def create_installer():
    """Create platform-specific installer"""
    # macOS: .dmg with app bundle
    # Windows: .msi with shortcuts
    # Linux: AppImage or .deb
Key Implementation Notes

No Network Communication: Everything runs locally
Memory Management: Critical for embedded models
Progressive Loading: App starts fast, loads models in background
Platform Considerations: Handle OS-specific paths and permissions
Error Recovery: Graceful handling if models fail to load

Testing Strategy

Test on machine WITHOUT Docker installed
Test offline functionality
Test memory usage with all models loaded
Test distribution package on clean systems
Test model download and caching

Success Criteria

 App runs without Docker or any external services
 Voice features work with embedded Unmute
 Models are managed efficiently (download/cache/load)
 Distributable via Briefcase to end users
 Memory usage stays within reasonable limits
 App starts quickly even with large models


### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Study the unmute submodule to understand how to directly integrate the models
2. **This Week**: Create EmbeddedUnmute class and test model loading
3. **Next Week**: Replace all Docker/service dependencies with embedded calls
4. **Following Week**: Implement model management and distribution strategy

The key is transforming from a service-oriented architecture to an embedded architecture while maintaining performance and user experience. This is definitely achievable but requires significant refactoring of the current approach.

	url = https://github.com/kyutai-labs/unmute.git
The submodule is configured but not initialized. Let me create a comprehensive integration plan based on the Unmute repository structure. I'll analyze the Unmute project from its GitHub repository to understand the architecture.
Unmute Integration Analysis
Based on the Unmute project (Kyutai Labs' streaming voice dialogue model), here's how to integrate it directly into Tektra:
🔍 Unmute Architecture Overview
Unmute is a streaming voice dialogue system with three main components:

Speech-to-Text (STT) - Real-time audio transcription
Language Model (LLM) - Conversational AI
Text-to-Speech (TTS) - Voice synthesis

📋 Direct Integration PlanUnmute Direct Integration Implementation PlanDocument # Unmute Direct Integration Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Initialize and Analyze Unmute Submodule

```bash
# In the tektra directory
git submodule init
git submodule update --recursive

# This will clone unmute into the unmute/ directory
```

## StAnalysis Summary
Based on my analysis of the Unmute integration requirements, here are the key findings:
🔍 Unmute Architecture Understanding
Unmute (by Kyutai Labs) is a streaming voice dialogue system that typically runs as separate services. To embed it directly into Tektra, we need to:

Replace Service Architecture: Current code uses Docker and WebSocket communication. We need to load Unmute's Python models directly in-process.
Model Components:

STT Model: Real-time speech recognition (likely ~500MB)
LLM Model: Conversational AI (likely ~2GB quantized)
TTS Model: Voice synthesis (likely ~250MB)


Key Integration Points:

Direct model loading using PyTorch
Streaming audio processing without network calls
Memory-efficient model management
Progressive initialization



🎯 Implementation Strategy
The artifact above provides a complete implementation plan with:

EmbeddedUnmute Class: Loads and runs Unmute models directly
EmbeddedVoicePipeline: Processes audio without external services
ModelManager: Handles model downloads and caching
App Integration: Progressive loading with user-friendly progress

📝 Immediate Action Items

Initialize the unmute submodule:
bashcd ~/Desktop/Devel/projects/tektra
git submodule update --init --recursive

Study the actual Unmute codebase to understand:

Model file formats and loading mechanisms
Streaming interfaces
Audio processing pipelines


Create the embedded integration layer following the plan in the artifact
Test memory usage and performance with all models loaded

This approach will give you a truly standalone desktop app that can be distributed without any external dependencies. The models will either be downloaded on first run or could be bundled with the app for offline installation.

markdown# Tektra AI Assistant - Complete Standalone App Implementation

## Context
We've just completed integrating Unmute directly into Tektra as an embedded component (no Docker, no external services). Now we need to complete the entire application to create a truly exceptional conversational AI assistant that requires minimal GUI interaction.

## Current State
- ✅ Unmute models integrated directly (STT, LLM, TTS)
- ✅ EmbeddedUnmute class implemented
- ✅ EmbeddedVoicePipeline working
- ✅ ModelManager handling downloads
- ❌ GUI components referenced but not implemented
- ❌ Agent system using mocks
- ❌ README still claims features not implemented
- ❌ No actual conversational UX

## Primary Objective
Create a **conversation-first AI assistant** that feels natural and requires zero manual/documentation. Think ChatGPT voice mode but as a native desktop app with additional capabilities.

## Phase 1: Fix Foundation & Honesty (Immediate)

### 1. Update README.md to Reflect Reality
```markdown
# Current Status Section (add after description)
## What's Working
- ✅ Embedded Unmute voice AI (STT, LLM, TTS)
- ✅ Cross-platform desktop app with Briefcase
- ✅ Model management and caching
- ✅ Basic Toga UI framework

## In Development
- 🚧 Conversational UI (basic chat works)
- 🚧 Agent system (using mocks currently)
- 🚧 Vision/multimodal features
- 🚧 Memory system

## Roadmap
- [ ] Week 1: Complete conversational UI
- [ ] Week 2: Implement working agents
- [ ] Week 3: Add Qwen for analytical tasks
- [ ] Week 4: Polish and optimize
Remove all "production-ready" claims. Change "Enterprise-grade" to "Ambitious open-source project."
2. Clean Up Imports and Mocks

Remove all Docker imports and dependencies
Update pyproject.toml to remove Docker
Fix all imports in app.py that reference non-existent GUI components
Create minimal working versions of missing components

Phase 2: Implement Conversational UI
3. Create Minimal Chat Interface
Create src/tektra/gui/conversation_ui.py:
python"""
Conversational UI - The heart of Tektra

Design Philosophy:
- Conversation is the primary interface
- Minimal chrome, maximum content
- Every interaction should feel natural
- Progressive disclosure of features
"""

class ConversationUI:
    """
    Main conversational interface.
    
    Layout:
    - 90% conversation view
    - Floating input at bottom
    - Minimal controls (mic, attach)
    - Status as subtle overlay
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Single conversation thread
        # No sidebars, no panels
        # Just conversation
        pass
Key Design Requirements:

NO traditional GUI elements unless absolutely necessary
Messages appear like chat bubbles with smooth animations
Voice state shown as subtle pulsing indicator
Agent activity shown inline (e.g., "🤖 Running code...")
Errors shown conversationally ("I ran into a problem...")

4. Implement Smart Message Rendering
Create src/tektra/gui/message_renderer.py:
Features to implement:

Markdown rendering for formatted responses
Code blocks with syntax highlighting
Inline images and charts
Collapsible sections for long content
Copy buttons that appear on hover
Smooth streaming text appearance

5. Natural Input Handling
Update input to support:

Auto-growing text input (starts as single line)
Paste images directly for vision analysis
Drag & drop files naturally
@ mentions for specific agents
/ commands that appear as you type
Natural language mode switching ("let's talk by voice")

Phase 3: Complete Core Functionality
6. Replace Qwen Mock with Simple Working Model
Create src/tektra/ai/simple_llm.py:
python"""Use a small, fast model that actually works"""
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

class SimpleLLM:
    """Fast, working LLM for development"""
    def __init__(self):
        # Use Phi-3-mini or similar small model
        # Must actually generate responses
        # No mocks!
This gives us real AI responses while we work on the rest.
7. Implement ONE Working Agent Type
Simplify agents to just one type that works:
pythonclass PythonAgent:
    """Just runs Python code safely"""
    
    async def run(self, code: str):
        # Use subprocess with timeout
        # Capture output
        # Return results conversationally
Features:

Natural language to code ("create a chart of...")
Show code before running (collapsible)
Display results inline
Handle errors gracefully

8. Conversational Memory
Implement simple but effective memory:
pythonclass ConversationMemory:
    """Remember what matters"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Store key facts from conversation
        # Semantic search for relevance
        # Surface memories naturally
Memory appears naturally:

"As you mentioned earlier..."
"Last time we discussed..."
"I remember you prefer..."

Phase 4: UX Excellence
9. Voice-First Interaction
Voice should feel magical:

Always listening mode: Wake word detection ("Hey Tektra")
Push-to-talk: Spacebar for quick questions
Auto-mode: Detects when you're talking to it
Visual feedback: Subtle pulsing when listening
Interruption: Can interrupt responses naturally

10. Progressive Feature Discovery
Users discover features naturally:

Start with just chat
Mention code → agent offers to run it
Paste image → vision features activate
Ask about files → file browser appears
Everything learned through conversation

11. Ambient Intelligence
Make Tektra feel aware:

Time awareness ("Good morning!", "It's getting late...")
Context awareness ("Since you're working on Python...")
Proactive suggestions ("Would you like me to...")
Natural personality without being annoying

Phase 5: Polish & Optimization
12. Performance Optimization

Stream everything (text, voice, results)
Lazy load features as needed
Cache conversations intelligently
Preload models based on usage patterns

13. Error Handling as Conversation
Never show error dialogs. Instead:

"I ran into a snag with that..."
"Let me try a different approach..."
"I need your help with..."
Always suggest next steps

14. Settings Through Conversation
No settings panel. Instead:

"Tektra, speak faster"
"Use a different voice"
"Remember that I prefer Python"
Settings persist naturally

Implementation Priorities
Week 1: Core Conversation Loop

Get basic chat UI working with real messages
Connect embedded Unmute to UI
Simple message rendering
Voice toggle working

Week 2: Make It Smart

Add simple LLM for text chat
Implement Python agent
Basic memory system
Natural language understanding

Week 3: Polish Interactions

Smooth animations
Progressive feature discovery
Better voice interaction
Error handling

Week 4: Ship It

Performance optimization
Briefcase packaging
Installation process
Basic documentation

Success Metrics

User can start chatting within 5 seconds
No documentation needed to use core features
Voice feels as natural as talking to a person
Errors never break the conversation flow
Features discovered through use, not menus

Technical Constraints

Must work offline after model download
Memory usage under 4GB with all models
Start time under 3 seconds
Package size under 500MB (without models)

Design Inspiration

ChatGPT voice mode's simplicity
Discord's floating input bar
Telegram's message animations
Notion AI's inline assistance
BeOS's attention to detail

What NOT to Do

❌ No traditional menus (File, Edit, View...)
❌ No settings panels with 100 options
❌ No modal dialogs ever
❌ No "wizard" setup flows
❌ No feature documentation in the app

Final Note
Every decision should be guided by: "Would this feel natural in a conversation?"
If you have to explain it, redesign it.
If it needs a button, try voice first.
If it requires a manual, it's too complex.
The goal: An AI assistant so natural that your grandma could use it without instructions.
Start with the conversation UI. Everything else follows from there.
