## Technical Implementation

### MicroInteractionManager Class
```python
class MicroInteractionManager:
    """Manages subtle micro-interactions throughout the UI."""
    
    # Key Methods:
    - setup_button_interactions()     # Configure button animations
    - setup_input_interactions()      # Configure input field animations  
    - setup_hover_effects()          # Configure hover animations
    - setup_focus_indicators()       # Configure focus animations
    - animate_button_press()         # Execute button press animation
    - animate_hover_enter/exit()     # Execute hover animations
    - animate_focus_enter/exit()     # Execute focus animations
    - pulse_attention()              # Attention-grabbing pulse effect
```

### Configuration System
- **Customizable Parameters**: Scale factors, durations, easing functions
- **Role-Based Configs**: Different settings for primary, secondary, and utility buttons
- **Performance Optimization**: Automatic quality adjustment based on system performance
- **Accessibility Support**: Reduced motion mode compliance

### Integration Pattern
```python
# Standard integration pattern used across all components:
def _setup_button_micro_interactions(self, button, button_id, config=None):
    """Set up micro-interactions for a button."""
    try:
        micro_manager = self.animation_manager.micro_interaction_manager
        element_id = micro_manager.setup_button_interactions(
            button, button_id=button_id, interaction_config=config
        )
        self.interactive_elements[button_id] = element_id
    except Exception as e:
        logger.debug(f"Could not set up micro-interactions: {e}")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Lazy Initialization**: Micro-interaction manager created only when needed
- **Performance Monitoring**: Automatic quality adjustment based on frame rates
