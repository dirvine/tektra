- **128K Context**: Extended context length for better conversation understanding and memory

### üåç Enhanced Language Support
- **8-Language Audio Processing**: English, Chinese, German, French, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese
- **Automatic Language Detection**: Phi-4-powered language detection from audio with high accuracy
- **Voice Auto-Configuration**: Automatic voice selection based on detected language
- **Cross-Language Processing**: Seamless handling across all supported languages

### üõ°Ô∏è Intelligent Fallback System
- **Automatic Fallback**: Seamless fallback to OpenAI Whisper when Phi-4 is unavailable
- **Graceful Degradation**: No interruption to service during model switching
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling with transparent failover
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

### üîß New API Endpoints
- `POST /api/v1/audio/phi4/load` - Load Phi-4 Multimodal model
- `POST /api/v1/audio/phi4/unload` - Unload model to free memory
- `GET /api/v1/audio/phi4/info` - Get model status and capabilities
- Enhanced `/api/v1/audio/transcribe` with Phi-4 primary processing
- Enhanced `/api/v1/audio/detect-language` with Phi-4 accuracy

### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **Faster Processing**: Unified model architecture reduces processing time
- **Better Accuracy**: Superior speech recognition and natural language understanding
- **Memory Optimization**: Efficient model loading with automatic device detection (CUDA/MPS/CPU)
- **Real-time Streaming**: Enhanced WebSocket processing with Phi-4 integration

### üîß Technical Enhancements
- **Device Optimization**: Automatic detection and optimization for CUDA, Apple Silicon (MPS), and CPU
- **Memory Management**: Efficient model loading/unloading with GPU cache management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling throughout the system
- **Import Safety**: Safe imports with graceful fallbacks when dependencies are missing
