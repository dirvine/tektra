# Tektra AI Assistant v0.9.5 - UV Environment Compatibility

**Release Date:** June 16, 2025  
**Type:** Critical Compatibility Fix

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed from User Testing**

This release addresses critical compatibility issues discovered during UV environment testing.

### ❌ **Problems in v0.9.4**
```
WARNING: Installation failed: /path/bin/python3: No module named pip
⚠️ Setup failed: There is no current event loop in thread 'MainThread'
ERROR: WebSocket connection error: get_current_user_websocket() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

### ✅ **Solutions in v0.9.5**
```
✓ Detected UV environment, using UV package manager
✓ Successfully installed ml_models
✓ Successfully installed transformers
✅ All ML dependencies installed successfully
✅ WebSocket connection established
```

## 🔧 **Critical Fixes**

### **1. UV Environment Compatibility**
**Problem**: UV environments don't include pip by default, causing all dependency installations to fail.

**Solution**: Smart package manager detection and UV-native installation.

```python
# Before: Always used pip
cmd = [sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install"] + packages

# After: Detects and uses appropriate package manager
def _detect_package_manager(self) -> str:
    if os.environ.get('VIRTUAL_ENV') and shutil.which('uv'):
        return 'uv'
    # ... pip fallback

def _get_install_command(self, packages: List[str]) -> List[str]:
    if self.package_manager == 'uv':
        return ['uv', 'add'] + packages
    # ... pip fallback
```

### **2. Async Event Loop Issue**
**Problem**: `asyncio.get_event_loop().time()` called from synchronous context.

**Solution**: Use standard library time instead of asyncio time.

```python
# Before: Async time in sync context
setup_file.write_text(f"Setup completed at {asyncio.get_event_loop().time()}")

# After: Standard time module
import time
setup_file.write_text(f"Setup completed at {time.time()}")
```

### **3. WebSocket Authentication Function Signature**
**Problem**: Function called with 2 arguments but defined to accept only 1.

**Solution**: Updated function signature to match usage.

```python
# Before: Single argument
async def get_current_user_websocket(websocket: WebSocket) -> User:

# After: Accepts optional token parameter
async def get_current_user_websocket(websocket: WebSocket, token: Optional[str] = None) -> User:
```

## 🚀 **Enhanced Package Management**

### **UV Environment Support**
- **Automatic detection**: Identifies UV environments vs. traditional pip environments
- **Native UV commands**: Uses `uv add` for package installation in UV environments
- **Fallback handling**: Gracefully falls back to pip when UV is not available
- **Enhanced logging**: Clear indication of which package manager is being used

### **Improved Error Handling**
```python
# Detailed error logging with stdout/stderr capture
if process.returncode != 0:
    logger.warning(f"Installation failed for {dep_name}: {stderr.decode()}")

# Success verification with helpful messages
if success:
    logger.info(f"✓ Successfully installed {dep_name}")
else:
    logger.warning(f"Installation completed but packages not available for {dep_name}")
```

### **Package Manager Detection Logic**
1. **Check for UV environment**: `VIRTUAL_ENV` set + `uv` command available
2. **Verify pip availability**: Test `python -m pip --version`
3. **UV fallback**: Use UV if pip fails but UV is available
4. **Safe default**: Fall back to pip commands as last resort

## 🔄 **Real-World Compatibility**

### **UV Integration**
```bash
# UV tool installation (your use case)
uv run tektra
# Now detects UV environment and uses 'uv add' for dependencies

# Traditional pip environments still work
pip install tektra
tektra
# Uses 'pip install' for dependencies
```

### **Installation Flow**
```
🚀 Starting Tektra AI Assistant...
✓ Detected UV environment, using UV package manager
🧠 Loading Phi-4 Multimodal model...
Installing PyTorch...
✓ Successfully installed ml_models
Installing Transformers...
✓ Successfully installed transformers
✅ All ML dependencies installed successfully
✅ Phi-4 Multimodal loaded successfully
```

## 🎯 **Technical Improvements**

### **Smart Dependency Installation**
- **Environment detection**: Automatic package manager selection
- **Error resilience**: Detailed error reporting and fallback strategies
- **Installation verification**: Confirms packages are actually importable after installation
- **Debug logging**: Comprehensive installation command logging

### **WebSocket Reliability**
- **Fixed function signatures**: All WebSocket dependencies now work correctly
- **Real-time features**: Chat, audio streaming, and voice processing functional
- **Connection stability**: No more authentication-related connection failures

### **Async Compatibility**
- **Thread-safe operations**: No more event loop conflicts during startup
- **Proper async context**: Clean separation of sync and async operations
- **Error prevention**: Eliminates common asyncio threading issues

## 📦 **Installation Experience**

### **UV Users (Your Environment)**
```bash
uv run tektra
# ✅ Automatically detects UV environment
# ✅ Uses UV for package installation
# ✅ No pip-related errors
# ✅ All dependencies install correctly
```

### **Traditional Pip Users**
```bash
pip install tektra
tektra
# ✅ Uses pip for package installation
# ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
# ✅ Same user experience as before
```

### **Mixed Environments**
- **Docker containers**: Automatic detection of available package managers
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Works with both UV and pip-based workflows
- **Development setups**: Seamless switching between environment types

## 🚀 **Ready for Production**

### **Deployment Compatibility**
